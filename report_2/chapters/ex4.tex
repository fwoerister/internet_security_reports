\label{fig:ttl-distribution}
\end{figure}

There seem to be standard values for TTL around 45, 110 and 230. Although they should be standardized there are some slight deviations from them.

\subsection*{rep-28}
The most recurring IP source address is \textbf{85.167.14.252}.
It is easy to find (e.g. by looking at the bytes histogram (figure \ref{fig:bytes-histo}) out that all packets this host sent were of the same size. In addition this host accessed a wide range of IP addresses and a wide range of ports. Additionally that this IP tries to connect to two random ports on a destination address. Therefore we can conclude, that this IP tries to do a horizontal scan, whereby each destination is probed on two random ports.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{rep-29}
The source IP address, that connected to highest number of destination Ports is again the source IP address \textbf{85.167.14.252}. This is the same IP address as in \textit{rep-28}. Hence it's has the same behavior.

\subsection*{rep-30}
The port, that is getting the most connections from different IP sources is the port 445. It is getting IP connections from 79793 different IP sources. It receives the biggest amount of packets from the source IP \textbf{190.253.254.250} (1240 packets). \\
